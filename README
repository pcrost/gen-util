VHDL General Utility Library

VHDL can be a super verbose language at the best of times. These helpers are
designed to ease the pain on a few of the more repitious VHDL coding constructs.

Compile all files into a VHDL library "gen_util" to use.

The Library is LGPL license. Go nuts with commercial usage. But contribute back
at the same time!
